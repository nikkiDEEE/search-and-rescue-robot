# Search-and-Rescue Robot

### ðŸš¨ Alex to the Rescue â€“ Search & Rescue Robot

**Alex** is a teleoperated search-and-rescue robot built by our team to autonomously map and visualize unknown environments using **LiDAR**, **Hector SLAM**, and **ROS**. Designed for post-disaster scenarios, Alex navigates complex mazes while relaying real-time environmental data to a remote operator.

**Key Features:**

* Built with **Arduino UNO**, **Raspberry Pi 3 (Debian)**, and **RPLiDAR A1**
* Real-time environment mapping using **Hector SLAM** in **ROS1 (Noetic/Kinetic)**
* Controlled remotely via **TCP/SSH** using a **PS4 controller**
* Dual-motor control with **DRV8833 H-Bridge**
* Sensor fusion with **ultrasonic sensors** for elevation detection
* Visualization through **RViz**

> Developed collaboratively by a multi-disciplinary team focusing on hardware, firmware, and software integration, all programmed primarily in **C++**.
